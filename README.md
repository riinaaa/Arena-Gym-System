# Arena Gym System
Arena Gym scheduling system is an application that helps the gym members book their Classes, check their membership.
Which is more efficient than going to the gym and wait in line 30 minutes before class to just to write their name on a piece of paper, or worse finding that
the class they went for is already full. 
Arena gym scheduling system will also give members the ability to check their membership and renewing if it expired.
